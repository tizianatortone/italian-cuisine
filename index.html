            <h2>Simple, but full of taste and quality.</h2>
            <p>
              Italian cuisine is one of the best-known and most appreciated
              gastronomies worldwide. It includes deeply rooted traditions
              common to the whole country, as well as all the regional
              gastronomies, different from each other, especially between the
              north, the centre and the south of Italy. One of the main
              characteristics of Italian cuisine is its simplicity, with many
              dishes made up of few ingredients, and therefore Italian cooks
              often rely on the quality of the ingredients, rather than the
              complexity of preparation.

            <p>
              The Mediterranean diet forms the basis of Italian cuisine, rich in
              pasta, fish, fruits and vegetables.Cheese, cold cuts and wine are
              central to Italian cuisine, and along with pizza and coffee
              (especially espresso) form part of Italian gastronomic
              culture.Desserts have a long tradition of merging local flavours
              such as citrus fruits, pistachio and almonds with sweet cheeses
              like mascarpone and ricotta or exotic tastes as cocoa, vanilla and
              cinnamon. Gelato, tiramis√π and cassata are among the most famous
              examples of Italian desserts, cakes and patisserie.
